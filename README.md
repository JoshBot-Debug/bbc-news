# BBC NEWS

This node CLI package fetches BBC news. I will keep making improvements, this project is basically meant to quickly check headlines.

This is the first npm package I've made, if you have trouble installing it or any other problems, please let me know so that I can learn and improve.

## Installation

You need to have node installed to install this package.

```properties
# install globally
npm install -g bbc-news
```


## Usage

```properties
# Display the menu
bbc-news
```

Then select what feed you would like to check. :smiley:
